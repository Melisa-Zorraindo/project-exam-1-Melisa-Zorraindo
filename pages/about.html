          There’s a large group of people out there who feel they can’t be happy
          and accepted because they don’t think they have the bodies they’re
          “supposed to” have. Unfortunately, what they feel they are “supposed
          to” have is an ideal they see in magazines, on television, and on
          social media that isn’t attainable by 90% of us. My goal is to
          challenge these unrealistic ideals of physical attractiveness, build
          positive body image, and improve self-confidence by helping you build
          a strong and healthy body that you'll be proud to show off. Want to
          get started? In this blog I offer high-quality training and nutrition
          coaching to maximise your bodybuilding success. Here for the ladies
          (and gentlemen too) who want to build muscle and shred fat.

          I began working out with my parents at the age of 6, and at the age of
          13, I was a weightlifter. I trained professionally for 2 years, until
          I decided to pursue a career in modelling. My modelling career lasted
          11 years and it was demanding, but very rewarding. In 2002 I took up
          bodybuilding and discovered that I love it. A year later I began
          competing. I got the first place on the WBFF in 2018 and 2019.
          Currently, I train ther women and help them achieve their goals,
          wheather they involve competing in world championships or just
          achieving a healthy relationship with food and their bodies in
          general.
